name: Retype Action for GitHub Pages
author: Object.NET, Inc.
description: |-
  Publishes a Retype website to a branch, directory, or creates a pull request.
inputs:
  branch:
    description: |-
      The name of the target branch where the Retype output will be committed. 
      Default is "retype"
    required: false
  directory:
    description: |-
      The relative path within the repo/branch where to commit the Retype output.
      Useful if you use GitHub pages to host from the "docs" folder on "main" 
      branch. Defaults to root of the branch.
    required: false
  update-branch:
    description: |-
      Set as true to push changes directly to the target branch, even if it 
      already exists. This will avoid the need for the action to create a pull 
      request. Default is false.
    required: false
  github-token:
    description: |-
      A GitHub Token used by the action to create a pull request in cases where 
      a new uniquely named branch is created. If the target branch exists and 
      "update-branch" is not true, then a pull request to merge the temporary 
      branch will be created. If this option is not set, the action may push a 
      new branch but will not create a pull request. Default is empty.
    required: false
